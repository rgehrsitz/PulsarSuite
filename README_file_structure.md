# PulsarSuite Canonical File Locations and Archival Policy

## Canonical Locations

- **Rules:**

  - All active rules must be placed in `/rules/`.
  - Only one set of rules should be used for E2E and production runs (e.g., `/rules/temperature_rules.yaml`).

- **System Config:**

  - Must be in `/config/` (e.g., `/config/system_config.yaml`).

- **Test Scenarios:**

  - All generated test scenarios for E2E and CI must be in `/output/reports/` (e.g., `/output/reports/generated_test_scenarios.json`).
  - Hand-written or legacy scenarios should be archived.

- **Test Results/Reports:**
  - All test results and reports must be in `/output/reports/`.

## Archival Policy

- All rules and test scenario files outside the canonical locations (such as under `/examples/`, `/examples/Tests/`, etc.) should be moved to `/archive/`.
- The `/archive/` folder is for legacy, experimental, or example files only. These are not used in E2E or production workflows.

## Example: Files to Archive

- `/examples/Rules/ThresholdOverTimeExample/rules/threshold_over_time_rules.yaml`
- `/examples/Rules/DependencyExample/rules/dependency_rules.yaml`
- `/examples/Tests/TemperatureExample/test_scenarios.json`
- `/examples/Tests/DefaultProject/test_scenarios.json`

## Example: Files to Keep (Active)

- `/rules/temperature_rules.yaml`
- `/rules/example_rules.yaml`
- `/rules/sample_rules.yaml`
- `/rules/advanced_rules.yaml`
- `/output/reports/generated_test_scenarios.json` (generated by E2E)

## Log File Locations and Purpose

- **/logs/**

  - Contains runtime logs for Pulsar, Beacon, and BeaconTester services.
  - Includes files like `beacon-*.log`, `beacontester-*.log`, `pulsar-*.log`, and subfolders such as `errors/`, `debug/`, and `structured/`.
  - Written by the running services during normal, production, or test operation.

- **/output/logs/**
  - Contains build and E2E workflow logs, such as `build-*.log`.
  - Written by automation scripts (e.g., `build-and-test.sh`) to capture the output of build, test, and scenario generation steps.
  - Used for CI, E2E, and troubleshooting build/test automation.

**Why both?**

- `/logs/` is for persistent, service-level logs (runtime events, errors, etc.).
- `/output/logs/` is for capturing the output of build/test automation.

This separation helps keep service logs and automation logs organized and easy to find.

## Notes

- Update scripts and documentation to always use the canonical paths.
- Add checks in build/test scripts to warn if stray files are found outside canonical locations.
- Archive new example or experimental files as needed.
