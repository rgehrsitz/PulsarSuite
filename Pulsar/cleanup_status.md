# Pulsar Runtime Cleanup Status

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Removed the `Pulsar.Runtime` project reference from `Pulsar.Compiler.csproj`
2. ✅ Updated `SystemConfig.cs` to use a `Dictionary<string, object>` for Redis configuration instead of the `RedisConfiguration` class
3. ✅ Fixed the `Program.cs` file to work with the new dictionary-based Redis configuration
4. ✅ Verified that the main `Pulsar.Compiler` project builds successfully

## Remaining Tasks

1. ❌ Update the test project to work without `Pulsar.Runtime`:
   - The tests currently reference `Beacon.Runtime.Services` namespace, which no longer exists
   - Need to update test files to use the dictionary-based approach for Redis configuration
   - Need to replace any direct references to `Beacon.Runtime.Services` classes

2. ❌ Update the benchmarks project to work without `Pulsar.Runtime`:
   - Similar issues to the test project

## Migration Strategy

The migration from `Pulsar.Runtime` to the template-based approach involves:

1. Using the templates in `Pulsar.Compiler/Config/Templates` as the single source of truth
2. Replacing direct class references with dictionary-based configurations
3. Ensuring all code that previously depended on `Pulsar.Runtime` is updated to work with the new approach

## Build Status

- `Pulsar.Compiler`: ✅ Builds successfully
- `Pulsar.Tests`: ❌ Build fails due to missing `Beacon.Runtime.Services` namespace
- `Pulsar.Benchmarks`: ❌ Build fails due to missing types from `Pulsar.Runtime`
