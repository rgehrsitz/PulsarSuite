## Implementation Approach

With the transition from Runtime to Templates now complete, our focus is on refinement and optimization:

1. **Maintain Template-Based Approach**
   - Continue using the template-based code generation approach
   - Keep templates in Pulsar.Compiler/Config/Templates as the source of truth
   - Ensure all templates are AOT-compatible

2. **Standardize Serialization**
   - Continue using System.Text.Json instead of Newtonsoft.Json for AOT compatibility
   - Ensure all serialization contexts are properly defined

3. **Enhance Code Generation**
   - Support all action types with proper validation
   - Ensure proper expression handling across all rule types
   - Generate optimized code for different deployment scenarios

4. **Improve Validation**
   - Make the sensor validation process more robust
   - Provide clear and actionable error messages
   - Add validation for complex rule dependencies

## Benefits of the AOT-Compatible Beacon Solution

The implementation provides the following benefits:

1. **Complete Separation**: Beacon is now a completely separate solution from Pulsar
2. **AOT Compatibility**: Full AOT support with proper attributes and trimming configuration
3. **Temporal Rule Support**: Proper implementation of circular buffer for temporal rules
4. **Test Project**: Generated test project with fixtures for automated testing
5. **File Organization**: Better organization of generated files into subdirectories by function
6. **Improved Validation**: Better validation of sensors and rule actions
7. **Streamlined Build Process**: CLI interface for easy generation of the Beacon solution
8. **Redis Integration**: Comprehensive Redis service integration for improved performance and scalability

This allows for better maintainability, performance, and deployment options.
