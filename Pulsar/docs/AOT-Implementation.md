# AOT Implementation

## Overview
Pulsar has successfully evolved into a fully **AOT-compatible** rules evaluation system. The transition from the runtime library approach to a template-based code generation approach is now complete. The previous **Pulsar.Runtime** project has been deprecated, and all its functionality has been **migrated into templates** within **Pulsar.Compiler/Config/Templates**. This refactoring ensures that Pulsar functions as a **code generation tool** that outputs a complete, **standalone C# project** named **Beacon** that contains all required runtime functionality, including Redis data integration, rule evaluation, and error handling.

## Goals
- **AOT Compatibility**: Ensure the generated project supports **AOT compilation** and produces a fully standalone executable.
- **Complete Standalone Execution**: The generated project should serve as a **self-sufficient runtime environment**.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Improve traceability between source rules and generated code for maintainability and debugging.
- **Build-Time Rule Processing**: Move all rule compilation and processing to **build time**.
- **Scalability**: Support **hundreds to thousands** of rules with maintainable code organization.
- **Maintainability**: Improve code clarity and **eliminate dynamic constructs** such as reflection and runtime code generation.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **CodeGenerator with Fixed Generators**: Updated implementation that uses RuleGroupGeneratorFixed to ensure proper AOT compatibility and SendMessage support.

2. **BeaconTemplateManager**: A template manager that creates a complete solution structure with:
   - Beacon.sln solution file
   - Beacon.Runtime project
   - Beacon.Tests project
   - Full directory structure and dependencies

3. **BeaconBuildOrchestrator**: An orchestrator that:
   - Takes parsed rules and system configuration
   - Generates a complete solution
   - Compiles the rules into C# source files
   - Builds the solution using dotnet CLI

4. **Enhanced Redis Integration**: Complete implementation of Redis services with:
   - Connection pooling
   - Health monitoring
   - Metrics collection
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Support for various deployment configurations

5. **Temporal Rule Support**: Improved implementation of circular buffer for temporal rules with:
   - Support for object values instead of just doubles
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Time-based filtering capabilities
   - Thread-safe operations

## How to Use

### Generating a Beacon Solution

```bash
dotnet run --project Pulsar.Compiler -- beacon --rules=rules.yaml --config=system_config.yaml --output=TestOutput/aot-beacon
```

### Building the Solution

```bash
cd <output-dir>/Beacon
dotnet build
```

### Creating a Standalone Executable

```bash
cd <output-dir>/Beacon
dotnet publish -c Release -r <runtime> --self-contained true
```

## Testing the Implementation

To test these changes:
```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the compiler with beacon template generation
dotnet run --project Pulsar.Compiler -- beacon --rules=rules.yaml --config=system_config.yaml --output=TestOutput/aot-beacon

# Verify the output files include the SendMessage method and SerializationContext
ls -l TestOutput/aot-beacon/Beacon/Beacon.Runtime/Generated/
```

## Future Improvements

1. **MSBuild Integration**: Add MSBuild integration for easier integration into CI/CD
2. **Enhanced Metrics**: Add more detailed metrics for rule evaluation
3. **Observability**: Improve logging and monitoring
4. **Rule Versioning**: Support for rule versioning and hot upgrades
